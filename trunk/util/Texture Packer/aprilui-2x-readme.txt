This Texture Packer project was set up in such a way that when you are merging HD graphics, it makes sure that
the generated coordinates are for the normally sized graphics. This is why the common divisors are set to 4.
It is recommended that you leave them at 4 because this will make it easier for you to make LD graphics as well.
If you don't need LD graphics, you can use 2.
